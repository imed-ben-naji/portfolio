              ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I&apos;m Imed Ben Naji, a DevOps & Data Engineer with a passion for cloud computing and automation. My journey into the world of technology began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a career dedicated to optimizing and orchestrating cloud infrastructures.
            </p>
            <p>
              <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 
              After earning my degree in Software Engineering from the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), I dove headfirst into the dynamic field of DevOps. I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working on projects that involve everything from implementing scalable Kubernetes clusters to automating complex deployment pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not architecting cloud solutions or optimizing data pipelines, you might find me:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> Developing applications and exploring new programming frameworks</li>
              <li><IoIosAnalytics className="inline-block mr-2" /> Delving into data analytics and learning more about data management</li>
              <li><FaBookOpen className="inline-block mr-2" /> Enjoying a good book or movie to unwind</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            At present, I&apos;m deeply invested in mastering the latest DevOps practices, with a focus on AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform, while also leveraging my experience in data processing and management. The intersection of development, data, and DevOps is where I thrive, and I&apos;m excited to continue exploring and pushing the boundaries in these fields. For me, every project is a chance to innovate and drive meaningful improvements, and that&apos;s what keeps me motivated.
