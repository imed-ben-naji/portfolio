              ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I&apos;m Imed Ben Naji, a Data Analyst with a knack for decoding complicated data and spinning it into a meaningful narrative. My fascination for math was nurtured from childhood, all thanks to my math-genius mother.
            </p>
            <p>
              <FaCode className="inline-block mr-2" /> 
              Post my two-year stint as a data analyst, I decided to plunge into the world of academia to pursue my master&apos;s. Here, I found myself teaching Transform Calculus, which was quite an eye-opener. I realized that programming and math weren&apos;t just two separate entities, they were two sides of the same coin. This understanding ignited my interest in data analysis and machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I&apos;m not crunching numbers or coding, you might find me:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><FaPizzaSlice className="inline-block mr-2" /> On a never-ending quest for the perfect pizza recipe</li>
              <li><FaHiking className="inline-block mr-2" /> Exploring new hiking trails (and probably getting lost)</li>
              <li><FaPuzzlePiece className="inline-block mr-2" /> Solving puzzles that make my brain do backflips</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At present, I&apos;m eagerly diving into the deep end of machine learning and dabbling in web development as a bit of a side hobby. The intersection of data science and technology holds endless possibilities, and I can&apos;t wait to explore them all. I&apos;m a firm believer in lifelong learning and self-improvement, so I seize every opportunity to learn, regardless of the circumstances. And honestly, making life a tad simpler with these skills - now, isn&apos;t that a fun thought?
